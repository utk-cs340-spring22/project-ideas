# SMART FRIDGE/PANTRY APP
### Louise Fry  

##### Fridge and pantry management apps have existed for a while. Theoretically they keep track of what you have in your inventory and help you find recipes you can cook with what you have on hand. However, they're not very practical for a serious cook.  Current apps make you scan the barcode of each item you have to add it to your inventory. This is TERRIBLE if you mostly buy produce or other fresh farmer's market/bulk stuff that lacks bar codes. They also lack the ability to mark a recipe as "cooked" and  decrements the ingredients accordingly. My project idea would implement both of these things and more, improving upon existing models.   

- Scan reciept from the store to update inventory (This does NOT exist in current apps! Exciting! 
   There are APIs that scan reciepts which I would be interested in using, 
   but idk if any are free/open source, and they seem mostly geared toward business. 
   Otherwise, I'm not sure If this is really within my skill set to implement. 
   Bar codes are universal but I'm not sure if different grocery stores use different identifiers...)
- Import recipes from popular sites or input your own
- Suggest recipes from database that can be made with what you have on hand 
- Add recipes to your Meal Prep Plan and it adds the ingredients you lack to your shopping list 
- Be able to mark a recipe as "cooked" and it decrements the ingredients --
   AND, if you have leftovers, has an option to add the cooked dish to your inventory 
   (Also a novel concept! Very good if you do meal prep ahead of time)
