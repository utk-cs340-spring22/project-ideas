#CS340 Project Proposal: Illness Sharing

##Summary
There are a number of us who are affraid of getting sick in the outside world, especially with the covid-19 situation (since early 2020). While doctors and scientists have come together to create vaccines for other types of diseases (a cold, the flu, covid, etc.), some people can still be weary of others due to how no one knows who is presently sick.

To resolve the issue of determining who is legitimately sick, and thus to steer clear from until they recover, "Illness Sharing" can track or document whatever illness a person may have and informs others about those diseases. In addition, the software (wich could be a phone app) can also approximately determine how long the strength of some vaccine will last should the user receive one at some point in time. 

This project will mostly be dedicated to those who are mostly paranoid of getting sick, but will be applicable to everyone else in the community.
