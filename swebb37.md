# Skyla Webb Project Proposal
## Paint Program

## Summary: 
I want to make a project that is something similar to a simple image editing software. This program would primarily give the user the ability to use "brushes" on a canvas generated when you run the program, and so therefore would involve a color wheel with which the user can select a color for their brush. Other features would be the ability to select shapes and put them on the canvas. The user would also be able to save their image to their computer, as well as reopen it for later. I would like this to be more complex than microsoft paint, but not as complex as something like photoshop, because of course, photoshop cannot be made in 3 months. The program will also have many of the same features as ms paint, but hopefully a larger variety of brushes and brush settings. If there is time to implement this, the user will also be able to open images and photos in this software and edit them.

## Problem being solved
This program is mostly for image editing purposes, so if you want to create an image, it should do that. It might also cure boredom.

## Features
* Edit images
* Create images (paint)
* Save and load images

## Languages
* C++
* Python (potentially)

## Who would buy / use this?
* People who enjoy art
* People who want to customize their brushes, but don't want as complex a program as PS or Krita
