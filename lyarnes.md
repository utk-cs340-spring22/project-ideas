#Project Proposal: Lucas Yarnes (lyarnes)

##What is the idea?
	My idea for a project is an agenda application that adds some features that I feel are missing from the mainstream calendar apps such as Google Calendar. While a calendar app such as Google Calendar is able to track these important events, what it lacks is an easy way to see what assignments/quizzes/exams are coming up. Yes, you can look ahead on the calendar, but you do not receive notifications of these events until just before they occur. Furthermore, Google Calendar isn’t designed for assignment tracking, its designed to keep track of events in your life. 

##Who would use it?
	This agenda app would be specifically designed for people in school that have assignments, quizzes, exams, etc. that they need to keep track of.

##Major features
	One major feature would be a sort of prioritized list that takes into account upcoming assignments/quizzes/exams and reminds you of these events with more notice. You would be able to tell the agenda approximately how long you expect an assignment to take to complete (hours, days, etc.) and it would remind you when to start the assignment accordingly. It would have a similar functionality for reminding you to study for exams. Aside from being more convenient, this kind of system would also help someone (such as myself) who has a bad habit of procrastinating, since I would receive constant reminders of upcoming assignments until I mark them as complete.
 
	Another feature would be a customizable “study window” that the user would set for each day of the week. This way, the app would know when to remind you to work on assignments during a time window when you are more likely to do them. For example, it isn’t helpful for a calendar app to remind me at 8am that I have an assignment due soon; however, a reminder between 2:30 and 5:00 is much more likely to get a response from me. 
Like any other calendar app, settings for repeating assignments/events would be present. Although I am not exactly sure how it would be implemented, I think having a difficulty setting for each assignment along with estimated time to complete would be nice, so the app could suggest which assignments to work on each day so that on any given day, you aren’t overwhelmed with assignments. 

##What tool sets would be used?
	This would be best in the form of a mobile application (for iOS and Android), so a tool like Unity would be best to use. Although Unity is traditionally used for game development, it isn’t limited to just that, so an app like this agenda would be able to be implemented in Unity using C#. I don’t think you would need any external APIs since the concept is pretty simple, but there are plenty of open source calendar-like projects that you could use as a starting point.
