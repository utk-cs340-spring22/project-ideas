  ## Summary
  The project idea I have for a semester-long idea is an app for weather. A weather app would not be extremely hard but could be made in a variety of different ways and designed   to perfection! Whether you want to code in python or HTML/CSS, you can choose what you are more comfortable with or code in a language you are not familiar with to push yourself. The problem being solved would be to come up with api’s and a project design for how you would want the app to look and how it would function. 
  ## Problem
  A weather app would be helpful for many people so they can prepare for the next day or even a few hours in advance in case of heavy storms or snow/ice.
  ## Major Features
  * current weather/daily
  * weekly forecast
  * temperatures, pictures, different visual modes (dark theme/light theme)
  * doppler radar
  * search for cities and states for weather 
  ## Languages and Tools
  * HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JavaScript
  * Python
  ## Buyer
  Companies that would want a weather app for users to access drom desktop or mobile phone.
